        <h3>Titled: My decision</h3>
        <p>Do you know that i am not growing younger anymore and i am no longer a kid...if then you know 
        so, why do you always want to make decisions for me as touching what to do and what not to do.
        Sometimes when i think about this, it makes feel like i don't have self-esteem and 
        beginning to doubt my ability to make good decisions and sense of judgement.</p>
        <p>Let me ask you this, if you always want to impose your decision on me at every slightest chance you have, 
        tell me, how would i become a man of my own? or is it until i start having grey hair that you will begin to believe me.</p>
        <p>Why can you try and see things from my own perspective and examine it for once? 
        rather than always forcing me into the frame of your perspective.
        I'm the one putting on shoe and i know where it pinches me! I am sick and tired of walking in my own shadow!</p>
        <p>Obviously, this is one of the reasons why God instructed Abraham to leave his father's house 
        and no wonder Jesus couldn't perform many miracles amongst his people.
        Thank you for everything you have done so far! It is high time i followed Abraham step.</p>
